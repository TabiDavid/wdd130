    <h2>David Tabi</h2>
    <p>Hello my name is David, I really like to learn new things and understand how 
        important is learn programing currently, I am working to have a major in Web Design 
        and Development.</p> 
        <p>I like to read books and also play the piano, guitar and 
        bass. I do not have any children yet, I am working as a teacher and something that 
        I really like from BYUI is the content and information that share with us 
        because is useful to the real world. </p>
        <p>I am taking this course becuase these
        credits are require for my major. This learning will help me to improve my 
        skills and have another options as a job. 
        <p>I have been member of the church for almost
        25 years and in a short time one temple will be dedicate in my country that is a blessing
        and is not close to my home but having a temple is better than nothing.
        I just wanna say that the church is true and God lives as His Son Jesus Christ.
    </p>
